---------------------------------------------------------------------------| Current Tasks: |---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Webpage-related/HTML and CSS

- increase size of viewer to full window 
-- note size discrepancies so that there isn't a lot of blank space on the page
-- image is typically 512x512px when loaded with cornerstone loadImage()

- combine all html to a single file to avoid weirdness with url 
-- (see https://cdorais1.github.io/CCS/UI/SecondPage.html URL as example)
-- If there's no landing page, then all of the code will be in a single file 
-- otherwise, we can move the code from UI/SecondPage.html to index.html 
-- can rename info.html to tool.html 


- remove top bar 
-- find a new spot for the logo, maybe at end of the tool bar?

- correct threshold slider
-- make into a single slider
-- add a text box area for users to type in values
-- set scale to HUs rather than pixel values 

- reorganize toolbar 
-- move toolbar to top of screen
-- have color selector be colors instead of text
-- shrink tool icons so they line up better

- statistics panel as floating window rather than a fixed box
-- change the font used to something that looks nicer
-- should not display the stats of colors that haven't been used on the images
-- should be able to be moved around screen as needed 
-- slight transparency so that images under box can be seen through
-- NYU project had this implemented; see if we can look at their project again for a reference?

- remove clear button and replace with eraser tool 
-- Jae specifically requested this; she would rather be able to do minute changes rather than trash her work entirely 
-- emphasis on the frustration that could occur if all annotations were cleared; maybe we can implement an "ARE YOU SURE???" popup when clear is clicked?
- "minimize UI"/ simplify display 
-- the name of the game is minimal design and has been for many years; how simple can we make our UI without losing valuable information 
    or making the experience cumbersome? Will require some trial and error to determine what is the best minimal example.
-- Button for eraser should be bound to both segmentation and annotation, but depending on last tool used, will switch between
   segmentation eraser or annotation eraser to make things easier for user and not have 2 "eraser" buttons 

- add "download annotations as JSON file" button to toolbar (currently bound to 'q' key)
-- need to determine what image denotes "download JSON" for ease of user understanding

- add button to allow for changes between axial, coronal, and saggital views of imaging
-- potential preview of each view in empty space on edge of display? 


JS-related


- correct threshold slider
-- make into a single slider
-- add a text box area for users to type in values
-- set scale to HUs rather than pixel values 

- implement json upload for tool restoration
-- current issues detailed in "issues" tab on github; will add additional found issues as needed.
-- THIS IS AN IMPERATIVE

- remove clear annotations code 
-- maybe comment out initially, and move to full removal
-- alternatively, maybe implement an "are you sure" so users are warned before ruining their work 

- zoom bound to right click and always active (click and drag cursor) && pan bound to mouse wheel click and always active 
-- Discussion with D. Haehn illuminated the difference between zoom/pan interactions with 2D images versus 3D images 
-- need to find a happy medium for users without clickable or existing mouse wheels (e.g. specialty mouses, touchpad users); 
   may need to incude a caveat on the information page of web app to let users know of alternative methods to access these tools.
-- See conversation on project discord 6/3/22 re: discussion of zoom/pan

- Allow for changing between cross-sectional orientation from coronal to axial to saggital to improve ability to annotate
-- current orientation is axial
-- saggital is plane that bisects the left and right side of a body 
-- coronal bisects the front and back of the body 

- need to implement a way to count individual blobs of paint annotations on the DICOM rather than by color; going to need 
  to use something like the percolation problem to find the paint blobs' boundaries  
-- Not necessarily imperative if users use single colors for single annotations as suggested by D. Haehn previously,
   but still a nice stretch goal 

- enable server upload for DICOMs and allow multiple users to annotate at the same time
-- need to look into this more; this is an entirely new field for this team and will require heavy research
