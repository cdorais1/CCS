                We are a team of five undergraduate students majoring in Computer Science at University
                of Massachusetts, Boston. This project helped bring us together and solidify our 
                abilities to collaborate and work as team due to the challenge of the task at hand and
                the desire to make a tool that could benefit researchers working on this necessary field
                of study. Our goal was to make a successful scanning tool that will meet the needs and
                expectations of our clients in the University of Pennsylvania's Radiology Department. We
                designed this tool to help with the phenotyping of calcific atherosclerotic plaque deposits
                in the carotid artery, but this tool can also be used for other medical purposes as needed.

                CCS is a browser-based, semi-automatic tool that helps users identify morphologic features of
                carotid atherosclerotic calcifications. The current goal of this project is based around
                allowing users to identify areas of calcific plaque build-up and calculating morphologic
                features of the deposit based on the user annotation. Users will be able to use the brush
                tool to paint on the medical images and get calculations based on those annotations with a
                single click on the "Display Statistics" button. Users can use the Plus and Minus button to
                change the size of the brush to allow for more precise paint strokes or faster coverage of
                large areas. They also have the opportunity to pick between five colors listed in a drop-down
                menu for annotations: Red, Green, Blue, Purple, and Pink. There is a "Clear Brushes" button
                that clears all of brush markings on the displayed image. In case the user does not want to clear
                all annotations, there is an option to undo single brush strokes as well as a redo button that
                will return the brush stroke. Other available tools are the Zoom button, the Pan button, and the
                Length button. The Zoom tool allows users to magnify or reduce the image based around the
                location clicked on by the user, the Pan tool allows users to move their image around in the
                viewer, and the Length Tool enable users to take the distance between two points on the image.

                Carotid artherosclerotic plaque in the carotid artery is a common cause of ischemic stroke in 
                the brain. Atherosclerosis is the deposition of inflamed fat in the vessel walls that lead to 
                hardening of the arteries. Hardened arteries with inflammation can result in unstable plaque,
                which can then break into pieces and travel to obstruct blood vessels in the brain. Lack of
                oxygenated blood flow can cause stroke, brain damage, and even death. Understanding plaque
                features that lead to instability is therefore absolutely critical for doctors to identify
                patients at risk for stroke. Calcific plaque is fascinating as it may have dual roles in both
                plaque stability and instability. This project involves helping researchers identify and
                characterize qualitative and quantitative morphologic features of calcific plaque. Using
                noninvasive diagnostic neuroimaging exams such as computed tomographic angiography (CTA) to
                image the blood vessels, users can identify patients with diseased vessels showing signs of
                atherosclerotic plaque buildup. Our client team includes neuroradiologists, vascular
                neurologists, and vascular surgeons at the University of Pennsylvania.
